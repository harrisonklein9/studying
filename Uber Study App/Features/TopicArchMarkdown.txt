### The Old Way of Doing Things
Prior to our architecture overhaul, we would render the home screen by calling on two services:
* *Get List Topics* service:
    * This request returns a list of topic id's that can then be used to call *"Get Topic"
* *Get Recommended Restaurants* service
    * This request returns a list of restaurant items

These services are owned by two different teams, **Recommendations**, and **Topics**.

Below is a diagram of these requests, and their responses. The responses are abbreviated to highlight the fields that are important for this example.
